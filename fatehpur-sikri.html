            <h2>Brief History of Fatehpur Sikri</h2>
            <p>Fatehpur Sikri, founded by Emperor Akbar in 1571, served as the Mughal capital until 1585. It was built to honor the Sufi saint Sheikh Salim Chishti, whose blessing led to the birth of Akbar's heir. The city, known for its stunning red sandstone architecture, was abandoned due to water scarcity. Today, it's a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a major tourist attraction.
