            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Fatehpur Sikri, a city in the Agra District of Uttar Pradesh, India, was founded by Emperor Akbar in 1571. The city served as the capital of the Mughal Empire from 1571 to 1585.</p>
            <p>Akbar established Fatehpur Sikri to honor the Sufi saint Sheikh Salim Chishti, whose blessings he believed led to the birth of his son and heir, Jahangir. The city's name, Fatehpur, means "City of Victory," commemorating Akbar's successful campaign in Gujarat.</p>
            <p>Fatehpur Sikri flourished as a center of art, culture, and commerce during Akbar's reign. However, the city's prominence was short-lived due to water scarcity and political instability, leading to its abandonment in 1585.</p>
