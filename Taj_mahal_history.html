        <h2>1. Pre-Construction</h2>
        <p>Before the inception of the Taj Mahal, the Mughal Empire under Shah Jahan's reign flourished culturally and politically. It was during this period that Shah Jahan met and fell deeply in love with Arjumand Banu Begum, who later became known as Mumtaz Mahal. Their relationship blossomed, and she became his favorite wife, accompanying him on his military campaigns and diplomatic missions.</p>
        <h2>2. Early-Construction</h2>
        <p>The early construction phase of the Taj Mahal began in 1632 after Mumtaz Mahal's untimely death during childbirth in 1631. Devastated by her loss, Shah Jahan envisioned a grand mausoleum to honor her memory. He selected a site along the Yamuna River in Agra and commissioned a team of architects, artisans, and craftsmen to bring his vision to life. The foundation was laid, and construction commenced under the supervision of chief architect Ustad Ahmad Lahauri.</p>
        <h2>3. Mid-Construction</h2>
        <p>By the mid-construction phase, the Taj Mahal began to take shape, with the main structure of the mausoleum and its surrounding gardens starting to emerge. Skilled craftsmen meticulously carved intricate designs into the marble facades, while artisans worked tirelessly on the inlay work using precious gemstones and semi-precious stones. The construction process faced numerous challenges, including logistical issues and financial constraints, but Shah Jahan's unwavering determination ensured steady progress.</p>
        <h2>4. Late-Construction</h2>
        <p>As the construction of the Taj Mahal neared completion, attention turned to the finer details and embellishments that would adorn the monument. The construction of the iconic marble dome, minarets, and ornate entrance gate reached its final stages, showcasing the unparalleled craftsmanship of the artisans. Shah Jahan spared no expense in creating a masterpiece worthy of Mumtaz Mahal's memory, employing the finest materials and skilled labor to achieve perfection.</p>
        <h2>5. Post-Construction</h2>
        <p>Following its completion in 1653, the Taj Mahal stood as a symbol of enduring love and architectural grandeur. Shah Jahan, grief-stricken yet proud of his creation, held lavish ceremonies to celebrate its inauguration, inviting dignitaries from far and wide. The Taj Mahal became a focal point of Mughal culture and a pilgrimage site for devotees of art and beauty. Over the centuries, it has withstood the test of time, captivating visitors with its timeless elegance and poignant symbolism. Today, the Taj Mahal remains one of the world's most iconic landmarks, attracting millions of tourists annually and continuing to inspire awe and wonder.</p>
